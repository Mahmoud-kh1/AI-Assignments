This project to solve a basic Game calle 8-puzzle which it has 8 number and one cell as empty cell ... the goal is to make it ordered in correct order and make 
the empty cell is the last one 
ex :  1 2 3
      4 5 *
      7 8 6
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      the valid move is to swap the empty cell and one of its neighbors up and down and  left and right if its in the grid bounds
      in this example we can just swap it with 6 (down move) 
      it will be 
      1 2 3
      4 5 6
      7 8 *
      which is our Goal 
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      there is many algorthim to do it .... I will solve it using BFS, DFS, Greedy , A*
